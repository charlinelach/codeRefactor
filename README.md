# Code Refactor
For this project, the purpose is to make the HTML and CSS code of the Horiseon page more efficient. It is also great progress for new developers to practice for future usage/understanding.
<br>
In the past, the homework for this project was to focus upon: semantic tags, alt attributes on images, altering CSS attributes, reducing CSS code, and making sure the page looks the same from before and after changes are made.
